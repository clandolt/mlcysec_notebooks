## ⚙️ How to Run the Notebooks

The website hosts HTML-exported versions of the notebooks for convenient reading on any device.  
However, we encourage you to run them yourself to gain hands-on experience.  
You can do this in three main ways:

### 🖥️ Run Locally (CPU)
All notebooks are available in this GitHub repository.  
You can also find them here:  
👉 [https://github.com/clandolt/mlcysec_notebooks](https://github.com/clandolt/mlcysec_notebooks)

- Designed to run on standard laptops (no GPU required).

### ☁️ Google Colab
Prefer to use a hosted environment or want GPU support? Use [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/intro.ipynb#recent=true).

- Each notebook includes a “Run in Colab” badge on the documentation website.
- Enable GPU support via: `Runtime → Change runtime type → GPU`.
